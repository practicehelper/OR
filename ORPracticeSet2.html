<p><strong>Question</strong><br />
What is an assignment problem in operations research?<br />
<strong>Answer:</strong><br />
An assignment problem is a type of optimization problem in operations
research where the objective is to assign a set of tasks to a set of
agents (such as workers, machines, or jobs) in a one-to-one manner while
minimizing cost or maximizing efficiency. Each agent can be assigned to
only one task, and each task to only one agent. The Hungarian method is
commonly used to solve such problems efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong><br />
Examine the concept of a Project Network in project management. How does
it help in visualizing task dependencies, optimizing workflow, and
ensuring timely project completion?<br />
<strong>Answer:</strong><br />
A Project Network is a graphical representation of project activities
and their dependencies. It shows the sequence and interrelation of tasks
through nodes (representing activities) and arrows (indicating
dependencies). It helps project managers visualize how tasks are
connected, identify critical paths, allocate resources effectively, and
avoid delays by pinpointing bottlenecks. This aids in optimizing
workflow and ensuring projects are completed on schedule.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong><br />
Examine the role of optimality tests in solving transportation problems.
How do these tests ensure that the best possible solution is achieved,
and why are they important in optimization?<br />
<strong>Answer:</strong><br />
Optimality tests, such as the MODI (Modified Distribution) method or the
stepping stone method, assess whether the current solution to a
transportation problem can be improved further. These tests calculate
opportunity costs for unoccupied cells; if all opportunity costs are
non-negative, the solution is optimal. They are essential in
optimization because they validate whether the minimum possible
transportation cost has been reached, ensuring efficiency in resource
allocation.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong><br />
Analyze the role of a decision-maker in decision analysis. Discuss how
they evaluate alternatives, assess risks and benefits, and select the
best course of action in alignment with organizational goals and
constraints. How do decision-making tools and techniques assist in
making informed choices?<br />
<strong>Answer:</strong><br />
A decision-maker in decision analysis plays a crucial role in evaluating
different alternatives under varying levels of certainty and risk. They
assess each option based on expected outcomes, align choices with
organizational objectives, and consider constraints such as budget,
time, and risk tolerance. Tools like decision trees, payoff tables, and
sensitivity analysis help in visualizing consequences, quantifying
risks, and making rational, data-driven decisions that support strategic
goals.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong><br />
What is the main purpose of using PERT in project management?<br />
<strong>Answer:</strong><br />
The main purpose of using PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique)
in project management is to handle uncertain activity durations by using
probabilistic time estimates—optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely.
It helps in identifying the critical path, estimating project completion
time, and analyzing the probability of meeting deadlines, thus enabling
better planning and control in projects with time variability.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong><br />
Analyze why an LPP might become infeasible and how different constraints
contribute to this situation.<br />
<strong>Answer:</strong><br />
A Linear Programming Problem (LPP) becomes infeasible when no solution
satisfies all the given constraints simultaneously. This can occur if
the constraints contradict each other, such as overlapping inequalities
that create an empty feasible region. Tight or overly restrictive
conditions, unrealistic resource limits, or conflicting objectives can
also lead to infeasibility, making it impossible to find a solution that
meets all the problem’s requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong><br />
How is an assignment problem different from a transportation
problem?<br />
<strong>Answer:</strong><br />
An assignment problem involves assigning a set of tasks to a set of
agents (such as workers or machines) to minimize the cost or maximize
efficiency, where each task is assigned to only one agent and vice
versa. On the other hand, a transportation problem deals with minimizing
transportation costs for distributing goods from several suppliers to
several consumers, where the supply and demand at various points must be
balanced. The primary difference is that the assignment problem deals
with one-to-one assignments, while the transportation problem involves
multiple suppliers and consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong><br />
Investigate the concept of Project Completion Time in project
management, including how it is determined and the factors that affect
it.<br />
<strong>Answer:</strong><br />
Project Completion Time refers to the total time required to complete a
project from start to finish, considering all tasks and activities
involved. It is determined by calculating the time needed for each task,
the dependencies between tasks, and the critical path (the longest
sequence of dependent tasks). Factors affecting project completion time
include resource availability, task dependencies, project complexity,
delays, and unforeseen risks. Proper scheduling tools like Gantt charts
or project networks help manage and optimize the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong><br />
Investigate why an optimality test is necessary even after obtaining an
initial basic feasible solution in a transportation problem. How does it
help in achieving the most cost-efficient solution?<br />
<strong>Answer:</strong><br />
An optimality test is necessary after obtaining an initial basic
feasible solution in a transportation problem to ensure that the
solution cannot be improved further. Without testing for optimality,
there could be better solutions that minimize transportation costs even
though the initial solution is feasible. The test checks the opportunity
costs for unoccupied cells and identifies if there’s a path that could
reduce the total cost. If all opportunity costs are non-negative, the
solution is optimal. This ensures the solution is cost-efficient and
meets the problem’s objective.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong><br />
Why is PERT useful in projects with uncertain activity durations?<br />
<strong>Answer:</strong><br />
PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) is useful in projects
with uncertain activity durations because it allows for probabilistic
time estimates, which account for variability in activity durations.
PERT uses three time estimates for each activity: optimistic,
pessimistic, and most likely, and calculates the expected time. This
enables project managers to estimate the overall project duration and
assess the likelihood of meeting deadlines. PERT is particularly
valuable for complex projects where precise scheduling is challenging
due to uncertainty.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong><br />
Compare and contrast infeasibility and unboundedness by analyzing their
causes and effects in an LPP.<br />
<strong>Answer:</strong><br />
<strong>Infeasibility</strong> occurs in a Linear Programming Problem
(LPP) when there is no feasible solution that satisfies all the
constraints simultaneously. This happens when the constraints contradict
each other, creating no overlap in the feasible region. The effect is
that no solution can be found that meets the requirements of the
problem.</p>
<p><strong>Unboundedness</strong>, on the other hand, occurs when the
feasible region extends infinitely in the direction of the objective
function, meaning there is no limit to the optimal value. This typically
happens when the objective function can increase or decrease
indefinitely without violating any constraints. The effect is that the
solution has no finite optimal value, and the problem is considered
unbounded.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong><br />
Analyze a real-world decision situation, such as a company&#39;s decision to
launch a new product or invest in new technology, and determine the best
decision under uncertainty using a payoff table.</p>
<p><em>In this case, assume the company faces three possible market
conditions: high demand, moderate demand, and low demand. The company
has two alternatives: invest in the new product or choose not to invest.
Construct a payoff table that compares the potential profits (or losses)
for each alternative under each market condition. Evaluate the outcomes
and determine which alternative provides the best possible result based
on the goal of maximizing profit or minimizing loss. Based on this
analysis, recommend the decision that offers the most favorable outcome
under uncertainty.</em></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>To create the payoff table, we place the
<strong>alternatives</strong> in the <strong>left-most column</strong>
and the <strong>states of nature (market conditions)</strong> in the
<strong>first row</strong>. Here&#39;s the updated table:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 37%" />
<col style="width: 18%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 18%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: center;"><strong>Decision / Market
Condition</strong></th>
<th style="text-align: center;"><strong>High Demand</strong></th>
<th style="text-align: center;"><strong>Moderate Demand</strong></th>
<th style="text-align: center;"><strong>Low Demand</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Invest in New Product</td>
<td>$500,000</td>
<td>$200,000</td>
<td>-$100,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Do Not Invest</td>
<td>$0</td>
<td>$0</td>
<td>$0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Evaluation Using the Laplace Criterion:</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Laplace Criterion</strong> (Equal Probability Criterion)
assumes that each market condition has <strong>equal
probability</strong>. Therefore, the decision-maker calculates the
average payoff for each alternative and chooses the one with the highest
expected value.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Invest in New Product</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Expected Profit = (500,000 + 200,000 - 100,000) / 3 =
<strong>$200,000</strong></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Do Not Invest</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Expected Profit = (0 + 0 + 0) / 3 = <strong>$0</strong></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong></p>
<p>Based on the goal of <strong>maximizing profit</strong> or
<strong>minimizing loss</strong>, the company should <strong>invest in
the new product</strong>, as it offers an expected profit of
<strong>$200,000</strong>, compared to the $0 profit from choosing not
to invest.</p>
<p><strong>Other Decision Criteria:</strong></p>
<p>While the <strong>Laplace Criterion</strong> provides a reasonable
approach under conditions of uncertainty with equal probabilities, other
decision-making criteria could also be used depending on the
decision-maker&#39;s preferences or risk tolerance:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Maximax</strong>: The decision-maker chooses the
alternative with the <strong>highest possible payoff</strong>, assuming
the best-case scenario (optimistic approach).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maximin</strong>: The decision-maker chooses the
alternative with the <strong>best worst-case payoff</strong>, focusing
on minimizing losses (pessimistic approach).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Minimax Regret</strong>: The decision-maker selects the
alternative that minimizes the potential regret of not making the best
choice, comparing payoffs to the best outcome for each state of
nature.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these criteria offers a different perspective based on the
level of optimism, pessimism, or desire to minimize regret in
decision-making.</p>
