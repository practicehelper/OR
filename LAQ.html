Programming (LP) is a mathematical method used to find the best

equations or inequalities that represent constraints and an objective
function to optimize. LP is widely used in business, economics, and
engineering for tasks like resource allocation, production scheduling,
and cost minimization. However, it has limitations, such as assuming
linear relationships, requiring precise data, and not handling complex
real-world situations with uncertainty or non-linear factors
effectively.

</td><td align="left">Constraints
play a crucial role in determining the feasibility and optimality of a
Linear Programming Problem (LPP). They define the limits within which
the solution must be found, such as resource availability, production
capacity, or budget restrictions. By analyzing constraints, we can
identify the feasible region, which represents all possible solutions
that satisfy the given conditions. Constraints also influence the
optimal solution, as the objective function (maximization or
minimization) is evaluated within this restricted space. If constraints
are too restrictive, they may lead to no feasible solution, while loose
constraints may result in multiple optimal solutions. Therefore,
analyzing constraints helps in understanding how limitations impact
decision-making and solution strategies in LPP.<br><hr></td></tr><tr><td align="center">218

</td><td align="left">In
Linear Programming, a bounded solution occurs when the feasible region
is enclosed, meaning there is a clear limit within which the optimal
solution exists. This ensures that the objective function, whether
maximizing profit or minimizing cost, reaches a definite optimal value.
On the other hand, an unbounded solution occurs when the feasible
region extends infinitely in at least one direction, implying that the
objective function can increase or decrease indefinitely without
reaching a maximum or minimum value. By examining these concepts, we
can determine that a bounded solution provides a practical and
implementable decision, whereas an unbounded solution may indicate
missing constraints or unrealistic assumptions in the problem
formulation.<br><hr></td></tr><tr><td align="center">221

</td><td align="left">To
solve a transportation problem using the North-West Corner Method
(NWCM) and determine the total transportation cost, follow a structured
approach. First, identify the given data, including the supply values
(sources) and demand values (destinations), along with the
transportation cost matrix. The cost matrix represents the
transportation cost per unit between different sources and
destinations.
Next, apply the North-West Corner Method by starting at the top-left
(north-west) corner of the matrix. Allocate as many units as possible
to that cell based on the minimum of supply and demand. Adjust the
supply and demand values accordingly. If a demand is fully met, move to
the next column; if a supply is exhausted, move down to the next row.
Repeat this process until all supplies and demands are satisfied,
ensuring that all units are allocated efficiently.
Once the allocations are made, calculate the total transportation cost
by multiplying the allocated units in each cell by their corresponding
transportation cost. Sum up all the computed values to obtain the final
transportation cost. While the North-West Corner Method provides a
feasible solution, it may not always be optimal. Additional
optimization methods, such as the Least Cost Method (LCM) or the MODI
Method, can be used to further refine the solution and achieve cost
efficiency.<br><hr></td></tr><tr><td align="center">223

</td><td align="left">An
Assignment Problem is an optimization problem where tasks or resources
must be assigned to agents in a way that minimizes cost or maximizes
efficiency, ensuring that each task is assigned to exactly one agent.
It is commonly used in various real-world scenarios. For example,
companies use it to assign employees to jobs based on their skills and
efficiency. In manufacturing, it helps allocate machines to tasks to
minimize production time. Logistics companies apply it to assign
delivery drivers to routes, reducing fuel costs. Educational
institutions use it to schedule teachers to classes efficiently, and it
also helps in matching students to projects based on their preferences.

cost matrix is usually a square matrix, and the goal is to minimize
total cost or maximize efficiency using methods like the Hungarian

Calculate the earliest and latest start and finish times for each task

This process helps in effective project management by identifying
critical tasks that directly affect the project timeline. Managers can
allocate resources efficiently, anticipate potential delays, and
implement corrective actions to keep the project on schedule.
For example, consider a simple project to build a small garden. The
tasks include preparing the soil (3 days), planting seeds (2 days),
watering daily for growth (5 days), and installing a fence (4 days). If
preparing the soil must be done before planting and watering must
follow planting, but the fence can be installed independently, the
critical path is preparing the soil &#8594; planting &#8594; watering, totaling 10
days. Since the fence is not on the critical path, delays in fence
installation will not affect the overall project completion time unless

This process enhances project management by helping managers identify

potential delays. By focusing on tasks within the critical path, they
can ensure the project stays on schedule while managing flexibility in
non-critical tasks.
For example, consider a project to bake a cake. The tasks include
gathering ingredients (10 minutes), mixing the batter (15 minutes),
preheating the oven (10 minutes), baking (30 minutes), and decorating
(20 minutes). Since preheating and batter mixing can happen
simultaneously, the critical path is mixing &#8594; baking &#8594; decorating,

the use of the Payoff Matrix in real-life decision-making. Have you
ever faced a situation where you had to balance risks and rewards
before making a choice? Explain how the Payoff Matrix helps in
evaluating different options and why it is a useful tool for making
better decisions.</td><td align="left"><p>The
Payoff Matrix is a useful tool for analyzing decisions where risks and
rewards must be carefully considered. It helps individuals and
businesses compare different choices and predict possible outcomes
based on various scenarios.</p>  

<p>For example, imagine you are deciding whether to take a new job with
a higher salary but more workload or stay in your current job with a
stable routine. The Payoff Matrix would list the possible outcomes of
each choice, helping you weigh the benefits of increased income against
the downside of added stress.</p>  

<p>By using a Payoff Matrix, decision-makers can systematically
evaluate their options and make informed choices. This structured
approach defends the idea that decisions should not be made impulsively
but rather through careful consideration of all possible outcomes.</p>
